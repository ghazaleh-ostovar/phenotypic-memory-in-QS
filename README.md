## Overview

Bacterial populations often coordinate collective behaviors using quorum sensing (QS), a density-dependent signaling mechanism. This project models how cells previously exposed to high cell density can exhibit an enhanced response due to the carry-over of signaling molecules from the QS-active (ON) state. This effect, known as phenotypic memory, arises from sustained cellular states rather than genetic changes.

Such memory can enhance responsiveness under dynamic or stressful conditions, such as antibiotic exposure, and may influence survival outcomes at the population level.


We explore:
- **Numerical models** based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
- **Analytical modeling** to generalize results and identify cellular parameters influencing memory
